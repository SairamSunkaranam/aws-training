    Subject: Request to Remove Bill Due to Unused Resources in Free Tier
    Message:
    Hello AWS Support,
    I am a new user exploring AWS services under the Free Tier. I recently found that I had mistakenly left some resources (e.g., EC2, RDS, or other services) running, which caused unexpected charges on my account.
    I was not aware that these resources were still active and accumulating charges. As a student/new user still learning AWS, I kindly request a one-time billing adjustment or credit for this usage.
    I have since stopped or terminated the resources and ensured that my account is no longer incurring charges.
    I would really appreciate your support and understanding in resolving this issue.
    Thank you very much.
